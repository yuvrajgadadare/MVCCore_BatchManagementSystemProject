                            Job oriented Data Science certification course to learn data science and machine learning using Python! Python which once was considered as general programming language has emerged as a star of the Data Science world in recent years, owing to the flexibility it offers for end to end enterprise wide analytics implementation. This data science training covers data handling, visualisation, statistical modelling and machine learning effectively with practical examples and case studies making it one of the most practical training. Even if you are looking for Python Data Science training with Real time project, CIIT is the right place.

                                <p>
                                    According to Simon Quinton, “If Analytics is the Engine, then Data is the Fuel of the 21st century.” Without data, businesses would not be able to uncover useful insights that could help streamline their business. After all, where would all the essential customer information come from, if not for data? Without customer data, it will be impossible to improve customer satisfaction or create personalized recommendation lists.

                                <p>
                                    As we mentioned earlier, the demand for skilled Data Science professionals, including Data Scientists, ML and AI Engineers, is on the rise. However, the supply of skilled professionals in the field is creeping up at a much slower pace. IBM maintains that by 2020, Data Science will take up 28% share of all digital jobs, but unfortunately, the job vacancies remain vacant for as high as 45 days due to the lack of talented applicants. Furthermore, IBM’s The Quant Crunch report states:
                                    <br /><br />
                                </p>

                                <h5 style="font-weight:bold">A lucrative and high-paying career</h5>
                                <p>

                                    Data Science is a highly advanced and exclusive field of study, and it is no doubt that professionals in this field make big money. For instance, according to PayScale, the average salary of a Data Scientist in India is Rs 6,99,928, and the average salary of a Data Analyst is Rs. 4,04, 924. All the job roles in Data Science have pretty much similar salary scale. The best part – since Data Science is still evolving, you will never have a stagnant career. There will be plenty of opportunities to learn, upskill, and earn more money.
